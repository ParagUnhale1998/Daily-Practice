          "content": "CSS Grid and Flexbox are two powerful layout systems in CSS. The main difference between them is in their layout model:\n\nFlexbox is designed for one-dimensional layout, either in a row or a column. It is ideal for aligning and distributing elements along a single axis, making it suitable for creating responsive navigation bars, card layouts, and vertical or horizontal centering of content.\n\nCSS Grid, on the other hand, is a two-dimensional layout system. It enables you to define both rows and columns, providing greater control over the layout of the entire grid container. CSS Grid is best suited for creating complex layouts with multiple rows and columns, such as magazine-style page designs or responsive grid-based designs.\n\nIn summary, use Flexbox for one-dimensional layouts and simple alignments, and use CSS Grid for more complex, two-dimensional layouts.",
